# Clash Royale Scoreboard 1

A fun little side project I hacked together in just a couple of hours for me and my friends’ Clash group.  
It’s basically a **live scoreboard** where we can add matchups, track wins/losses, and keep things a bit competitive.

### Features
- Add new matchups (Player A vs Player B, with optional mode/title).
- Update scores with a simple `+1` button.
- Cooldowns built in to prevent spam/tampering (2 min for +1, 10 min for reset/delete).
- Reset or delete matchups (two-tap confirmation with cooldown).
- Real-time sync using **Firebase Firestore** so everyone sees the same scores instantly.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages — no setup required.

### Why?
Mostly for fun — we wanted a quick and easy way to keep score in our Clash Royale group without overthinking it.  
And honestly, it was cool to see how fast something like this can come together in just a short build sprint.

### Tech Stack
- **HTML** (vanilla, no frameworks).
- **Firebase Firestore** for real-time database.
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting.

Just a small project, nothing serious — but it’s been fun to build and use.
